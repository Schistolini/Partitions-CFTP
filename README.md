# Partitions-CFTP
Mathematica implementation of Coupling From the Past on plane partitions.

This is the code used to generate the final project for Sam Chistolini in Math 457 (Partition Theory) at Williams College in Spring 2024.

The .tex files are used to create a short expository piece which explains the code in greater detail (for the purpose of demonstrating to the reader that the implementation in PlanePartition_Mathematics.nb faithfully implements Coupling From the Past on Plane Partitions as described in its initial work by Propp and Wilson. There is also a brief discussion of the mathmatical explanation for Coupling From the Past, which paraphrases the main theoretical details of the Propp and Wilson paper. I refer the reader to that paper for more information, and the citation for the paper can be found on the last page of M457_Project.pdf.

PlanePartition_Mathematica.nb is a Mathematica notebook which implements all of the functions requried to implement Coupling From the Past. The use of Mathematica is motivated by a notebook found on the Wolfram Mathematica website, which implements the main graphical features of the animation provided. It is because of this work that I chose to work in Mathematica, even though the program is neither open source, nor free to use. I again refer the reader to the last page of M456_Project.pdf for a full citation, and a link where the original code can be downloaded.

There are various .mov files in this repository, and readers unable to use Mathematica can reach out to me at

If you have any questions, or would like to see more .mov files, which were too large to upload directly to GitHub.

The Mathematica file was written quickly to fit a project timeline during a semester where I was finalizing on my undergraduate thesis. A sufficiently motivated reader could very easily find (potentially large) speedups in my code. Please feel free to do so!
